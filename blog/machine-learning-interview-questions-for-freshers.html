<h3>Que 1. What is Machine Learning?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Machine Learning is a subset of AI where algorithms learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every rule.

<h3>Que 2. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Supervised: Trains on labeled data (features + target). Used for classification/regression.<br>
Unsupervised: Trains on unlabeled data to discover structure (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).

<h3>Que 3. What is classification vs. regression?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Classification: Predicts discrete categories (e.g., spam/not spam).<br>
Regression: Predicts continuous values (e.g., house price).

<h3>Que 4. What is overfitting?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise/specific patterns in training data and performs poorly on new data. It generalizes badly.

<h3>Que 5. How can you reduce overfitting?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Use more data or data augmentation,<br>
Apply regularization (L1/L2, dropout),<br>
Simplify the model,<br>
Use cross-validation and early stopping.

<h3>Que 6. What is underfitting?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Underfitting happens when the model is too simple to capture underlying patterns, leading to poor performance on both training and test data.

<h3>Que 7. Explain bias–variance trade-off.</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Bias is error from overly simple assumptions; variance is error from excessive sensitivity to data. Good models balance low bias and low variance to generalize well.

<h3>Que 8. What is a training set, validation set, and test set?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Training: For learning model parameters.<br>
Validation: For tuning hyperparameters and model selection.<br>
Test: For final, unbiased performance evaluation.

<h3>Que 9. What is cross-validation?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> A technique (e.g., k-fold) that splits data into multiple folds to train and validate repeatedly, providing a more reliable estimate of model performance.

<h3>Que 10. What is a confusion matrix?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> A table for classification that shows true/false positives and negatives, helping derive metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

<h3>Que 11. Define precision, recall, and F1-score.</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Precision: TP / (TP + FP) — how many predicted positives are correct.<br>
Recall: TP / (TP + FN) — how many actual positives are found.<br>
F1: Harmonic mean of precision and recall; balances both.

<h3>Que 12. What is accuracy and when can it be misleading?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Accuracy = (correct predictions / total). It can be misleading on imbalanced datasets where one class dominates.

<h3>Que 13. What is ROC curve and AUC?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> ROC plots TPR vs. FPR at various thresholds. AUC measures area under the ROC; higher AUC indicates better separability.

<h3>Que 14. What is regularization (L1/L2)?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Regularization adds a penalty to the loss to discourage overly complex models. L1 (Lasso) encourages sparsity; L2 (Ridge) shrinks weights smoothly.

<h3>Que 15. What is feature scaling and why is it needed?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Scaling (standardization/normalization) puts features on similar ranges so gradient-based methods and distance-based models work effectively.

<h3>Que 16. What is gradient descent?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> An optimization algorithm that iteratively updates parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss to find minima.

<h3>Que 17. What are hyperparameters vs. parameters?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Parameters: Learned from data (e.g., weights).<br>
Hyperparameters: Set before training (e.g., learning rate, depth, C, k) and tuned via validation.

<h3>Que 18. What is k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> A simple algorithm that classifies a point based on the majority label among its k closest neighbors (distance-based). Works for regression too (average of neighbors).

<h3>Que 19. What is linear regression and its assumptions?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Predicts a continuous target as a linear combination of features. Common assumptions: linearity, independent errors, homoscedasticity, and normality of errors (approximate).

<h3>Que 20. What is logistic regression?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> A classification algorithm modeling the probability of a class using the logistic (sigmoid) function; outputs probabilities and class labels via a threshold.

<h3>Que 21. What is a decision tree and its pros/cons?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Decision Tree: Splits data by feature thresholds to form a tree of decisions.<br>
Pros: Interpretable, handles nonlinearity, little preprocessing.<br>
Cons: Prone to overfitting; unstable to small data changes.

<h3>Que 22. What are ensemble methods (Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting)?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Bagging: Train models on bootstrapped samples and average (reduces variance).<br>
Random Forest: Bagging + random feature selection at splits.<br>
Boosting: Sequentially trains weak learners to correct previous errors (e.g., AdaBoost, XGBoost).

<h3>Que 23. What is PCA and when is it used?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Principal Component Analysis reduces dimensionality by projecting data onto directions with maximum variance, helping visualization, noise reduction, and speed.

<h3>Que 24. What is one-hot encoding vs. label encoding?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
One-hot: Creates binary columns per category (no order).<br>
Label: Assigns integer IDs (implies order; suitable for tree models, but may mislead linear models).

<h3>Que 25. What is the difference between epochs, batches, and batch size?</h3>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Epoch: One full pass over the training data.<br>
Batch: A subset processed before updating parameters.<br>
Batch size: Number of samples in one batch.
